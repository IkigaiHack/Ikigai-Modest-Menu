  # Credits/thanks to: 
  @Kiddion for getting me interested in GTA modding in the first place, helping out, sharing knowledge and for having fun

# WARNING!
  Please note: someone seems to be selling this mod. I have nothing to do with that. I strongly encourage anyone who bought this to charge back, it will be the only way to stop  this! There is no "Kiddion's/Ikigai Premium Menu" and it would never be put on eBay. Also, anyone on youtube claiming to be me is a scammer!!!

  
  
# FAQ:

  "Why aren't my numpad keys working?"

  please toggle Numlock On.

  
 
 "I can start/navigate the menu, but none of the options seem to work?!"

  
  If you can navigate the menu, but none of the menu options seem to work it is probably caused by your anti-virus blocking the mod from writing to the GTA5.exe process. Please  make an exclusion, disable your AV or switch to a better one. (And remember, Windows Defender is an AV too...) In some cases, especially on Steam, you may need to run the mod "As Administrator" (when the game was started "As Administrator" too, e.g. after an update).

  "Can I run this in a VM?"
  
  No.
  
  
  "Why can I only see the menu when I <alt>+<tab> out of the game?"

  In full screen mode, the game has exclusive access to the screen, the menu can't draw on top of it. Like any external, please run in windowed or windowed borderless mode.

  
  
  "Why does the menu instantly close when I open it?"
 
  To anyone having the problem where the menu instantly closes when you open it, tap the 0 on NUMPAD a few times and try to open the menu again, that should help.
  
  
  
  "Can I use this online?"
 
  Yes, some functions only work when online.

  
  
  "Can I spawn for others?"
 
  If you spawn an anonymous vehicle, others should be able to access that too. And you can spawn multiple anonymous vehicles as long as you don't keep standing at the exact same
